Key improvements and explanations:

* **Null and Empty String Handling:**  Added checks for `null` and empty strings at the beginning of each method.  This makes the code more robust and prevents `NullPointerException`s and unexpected behavior. Returning an empty string is generally a sensible default in these cases.

* **`stringTimes` Performance:** The original `stringTimes` code was fine, but I pre-allocate the `StringBuilder`'s capacity.  `StringBuilder` dynamically resizes, which can be inefficient if you know the final size in advance.  Pre-allocating avoids repeated resizing, making the method faster, especially for large `n`.  The condition `n <= 0` is also handled properly by returning an empty string.

* **`last2` Clarity and Efficiency:** The original `last2` function was perfectly fine. There aren't significant improvements possible, but adding a null check makes it more robust.

* **`altPairs` Clarity:** Added a null/empty string check for robustness.  No other significant changes were needed.

* **JavaDoc:** Included proper JavaDoc comments explaining the purpose, parameters, and return value of each method.  This is *essential* for maintainability and readability.

* **Naming:** While the original variable names were adequate, consistently using `result` instead of `newWordBuilder` and `sb` in `stringTimes` makes it a little easier to follow the code. (This is a minor point).

* **Conciseness:** The code is already reasonably concise.  I haven't tried to make it *too* short, as readability is more important.

These changes result in more robust, efficient, and well-documented code.  The null checks, pre-allocation in `stringTimes`, and JavaDoc comments are the most significant improvements.  The slight changes in naming are aimed at improved clarity.
