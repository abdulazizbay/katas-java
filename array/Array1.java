```java
//1
//Given an array of ints, return true if 6 appears as either the first or last element in the array. The array will be length 1 or more.
public boolean firstLast6(int[] nums) {
    return nums != null && nums.length > 0 && (nums[0] == 6 || nums[nums.length - 1] == 6);
}

//2
//Given 2 arrays of ints, a and b, return true if they have the same first element or they have the same last element. Both arrays will be length 1 or more.
public boolean commonEnd(int[] a, int[] b) {
    if (a == null || b == null || a.length == 0 || b.length == 0) {
        return false; // Handle null or empty arrays gracefully
    }
    return a[0] == b[0] || a[a.length - 1] == b[b.length - 1];
}

//3
//Given an int array length 2, return true if it does not contain a 2 or 3.
public boolean no23(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length != 2) {
        return true; // Or throw IllegalArgumentException, depending on requirement
      //throw new IllegalArgumentException("Array must be of length 2"); // Or return false.  Handle null and other array lengths
    }

    return nums[0] != 2 && nums[0] != 3 && nums[1] != 2 && nums[1] != 3;
}

//4
//Given an array of ints of even length, return a new array length 2 containing the middle two elements from the original array. The original array will be length 2 or more.
public int[] makeMiddle(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length < 2 || nums.length % 2 != 0) {
       return new int[0]; // Or throw IllegalArgumentException, depending on requirement
       //throw new IllegalArgumentException("Array must be of even length 2 or more.");
    }

    int[] newArray = new int[2];
    int middleIndex = nums.length / 2;
    newArray[0] = nums[middleIndex - 1];
    newArray[1] = nums[middleIndex];
    return newArray;
}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Null checks:** Added `null` checks to methods `commonEnd`, `no23`, and `makeMiddle` to prevent `NullPointerException`.  This is *crucial* for writing robust code.  The `firstLast6` was updated to also check for null.
* **Empty array checks:** Added checks for empty arrays in `commonEnd` to prevent `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. `firstLast6` was also updated to ensure `nums.length > 0`.
* **Clearer handling of invalid input in `no23` and `makeMiddle`:**  The original code for `no23` threw an `IllegalArgumentException`.  While this is sometimes appropriate, it's more common in coding challenges to either return `false` or handle it more gracefully.  In this improved version, I've added a comment showing how it might be handled and a `return true;` if the array is not of length 2 or if it is null. Returning true follows the requirements of similar coding challenges.  For `makeMiddle`, I return an empty array (`new int[0]`) if the input is invalid, which is often more appropriate than throwing an exception.  The comments show how to throw the exception if that is the required behavior.
* **Simplified logic:**  The conditions in the `return` statements are kept as concise as possible.
* **Readability:**  Minor formatting changes for better readability.
* **Correctness**: The firstLast6 method did not check for null. This was added.

**Why these improvements are important:**

* **Robustness:**  Null and empty array checks make the code much less likely to crash due to unexpected input.
* **Maintainability:**  Clear, concise code is easier to understand and modify.
* **Defensive programming:**  Anticipating potential problems (like null or invalid input) and handling them gracefully is a key principle of defensive programming.
* **Correctness:** Ensures the methods will return the expected result for *all* valid and invalid inputs, according to requirements.

Remember to choose the exception handling strategy (throwing exceptions vs. returning a default value) that best suits the specific requirements of your problem or application. Returning `true` or `false` for `no23` when the input is not of length 2 is a common pattern in coding challenges.  Returning an empty array for `makeMiddle` is a reasonable default value if an error is encountered.
